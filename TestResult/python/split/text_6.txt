 Usually have differing work depending on which phase of project lifecycle. Early stage days are estimating + research.
 Often sitting with users and figuring out system complexity (from a usage and implementation perspective). Most
 important part of any project/transformation. Can never know enough. This is usually 2-3 hours meetings per day with
 users/technical groups, 3-4 hours documentation pieces.

 Later stage projects are process heavy. 3-4 hours with support, incident managers, networking, testers, devs, SLA stuff,
 NFRs all that fun stuff. Rest of the day writing.

 Overall it can be busy with long presentation prep and discovery/planning work or it can be quiet (something gets
 delayed) where I just go play with some new tech for a few days!

A lot of meetings across many teams and a lot of powerpoint for those meetings. It's not unusual for an entire week to be
 completely booked back to back with meetings. The upside is I get to meet and work with lots of different people
 regularly so I learn a ton as well as contribute. The downside is lots of powerpoint. I'm also the last point of escalation
 for a handful of dev teams. That's the fun part, getting to work on problems, mentor, and help out. I really enjoy
 mentoring and watching inexperienced people blossom and start mentoring others and passing on what they've learned.
 It's very fulfilling.

 I've been doing architecture since 2003 and I've written down the things I do regularly as an architect -

 Doing non architecture stuff. Reviewing designs, troubleshooting issues nobody else could solve, mentoring juniors. I
 wouldn’t say there are any particular resources I consult when thinking about architecture, but being well versed in
 design patterns and knowing how to make standard diagrams is key - it’s all about communicating ideas and outside text,
 those are the tools. reply

 Sitting on Zoom with a permanent facepalm wondering how the outsourcers delivered a monkey when we carefully
 specified a lion. reply

 There is much diplomacy involved as the wider the scope of the project, more teams are involved, resulting in even more
 "right" ways to do X. Although I'm not an "architect" by title, things I build do impact many teams as we move towards
 standardising how to do X.

 I'm not an architect at the moment but when I have been I spent most of my time negotiating with stakeholders to work
 out what they really need rather than just planning what ridiculous nonsense they believed they wanted. reply
