 I end up doing all the BA / PO / Scrum work and go to a lot of high-level meetings where POs give me some vague
 requirements they wrote down in 15 minutes between taking their kids to school and soccer practice. Then I cover for the
 scrum master who takes off on critical release days. Then I go to meetings and track down people to clarify requirements
 and do an architecture diagram or two and write stories from it and get it "approved" by the PO.

 I also pick up stories the team doesn't want, since I feel responsible for them not being clear / easy / broken up enough.
 In the evenings, I study for cloud exams.

 Resources I have found useful is really understanding flowcharts, and the difference between flowcharts and high-level
 architecture diagrams.
