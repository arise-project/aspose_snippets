 This is basically my own experience as well. reply

 I've had an "architect" job in some form or another for 20+ years, so have learnt plenty of things that would have greatly
 surprised my younger self... My day job is basically to be a "force multiplier" and it boils down to:

    • cat herding = meetings, discussions, negotiation, "shoulder to cry on" = way more soft skills then I ever thought I'd
      need

    • Big picture stuff = "town planning" for tech, second order thinking, pulling together cohesive plans/strategies,
      principles, constraints = way harder to effectively communicate this stuff than my younger stuff would have
      thought

    • rapid altitude changes = dropping from the 10000ft view down to helping a team troubleshoot some production
      issue, helping a junior dev with a code issue, solving a dispute between devs, hands on evaluation of some new
      tech, then jumping back up to talk to a leadership team about some new grand strategy, or to planning out a multi
      year program of work = a ton of skills that my younger self would have never have guessed at, finance, budgets,
      "business" language, operating models along with keeping my technical skills sharp

 In terms of resources:

    • Anything around learning to story tell and communicate effectively

    • The "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know" essays

    • Your tech skills - write PoC apps, side-projects, try out new tech, learn to quickly grok strengths & weaknesses of
      tech

 Noticing a theme already.. architects are fun killers! “Good architects prefer plain, old working tools.”

 “Fight the urge to use ‘latest and coolest’ technology. (…) Stick to what works. Even when it's boring.”

 "Inspire the team and younger devs to avoid complex tools and solutions and stick to the basics”

           architects are fun killers! I strongly disagree with this. Fun killers are working late nights to
           remedy poor planning, or getting paged multiple times every night because people didn't make
           informed choices. It kills the fun for the employees as well as others they interact with.

A good architect includes someone who understands the needs of the people in terms of growth and satisfaction. They'll
 push back on schemes that introduce toil and try to align around good bets that contribute to your skill set. That may
 involve blocking use of technology X which has Y long term consequences. The consequences of that long-term choice
 need to have counters to keep the people engaged, so the good architect considers how to manage that. They don't always
 get that right and we have some less well-rounded architects, but we should aspire to doing this.
