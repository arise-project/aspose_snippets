 Most likely because they are:

    • Experienced devs who have "seen it all"

    • Have to deal with the consequences and have more responsibility

 That is what it should be. From what I've seen most architects aren't like this, they play with whatever is cool then move
 on to the next company while the rest of us try to untangle the mess. reply

 Let's say 'Good architects are fun killers' - but really there is still a lot of fun to be had - and if not maybe one should
 move to a more mentally challenging job haha. reply

 I believe that the job description differs a lot from company to company. From my experience, the best architects spent
 most of their time focusing on these things:

   1. Always understand what the current business priorities are.
   2. Design the overall system architecture so it covers all of the business needs, and nothing more. Always focus on
      keeping it as simple as possible. Even when people argue "lets do this some other way, because we might need it in
      the future".
   3. Fight the urge to use "latest and coolest" technology. Don't listen to consultants selling you unnecessary tech. Stick
      to what works. Even when it's boring. Explain it properly to your team.
   4. Maintain proper documentation. Focus on making it as simple as possible, easy to adjust and up to date. Otherwise
      its value will be close to 0.
   5. Use UML diagrams. Think about where the complexity of the given system is, and use only the most relevant
      ones. For example, if the complexity lies in complex workflows, use sequence diagrams or state diagrams. If the
      complexity lies in complex datamodel, use ERD diagrams. But more often than not, architects also have to focus
      on other things, mostly related to DevOps, Platform Engineering and overall developer workflows. [shameless
      plug] That's one of the reasons I founded https://stacktape.com - AWS-focused "internal developer platform" that
      allows developers to do this sort of stuff on their own, without involvment of architects, DevOps or others.

Well I work for a small government and my responsibilities tend to be a little less structured or more fluid in nature. I
 have to adapt at times and crunch code just as much as I scope requirements and write technical documents. Meetings
 here and there, lot's of talking to people and lots of reading. Currently I'm working on a digital transformation strategy
 and I can definitely see myself writing a whole lot in the next few months to gather traction on the implementations that
 are needed.

 I would say that at least for me, becoming a Software Architect has meant that I need to split my time between
 groundwork and strategising with an added layer of complexity that stems from the fact that I work for government, so
 there are a number of policies and internal bureaucratic barriers to get used to.
