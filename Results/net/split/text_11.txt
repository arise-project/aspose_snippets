I’m not an architect, but used to closely work with one and it was a pleasure. The key role that our architect played that
brought immense value to us was being the integrator of teams. Teams had a high level of autonomy when it comes to
implementation details which meant there could easily be “reinventions”, incompatibilities, and even narrow minded
choices. Our Architect always had the big picture view across teams, almost always sat in our feature grooming sessions
with valuable inputs, worked closely with product owners who bring in feature requests that may need integration of
multiple services etc.

Above all, he was very active, and approachable to all teams instead of hiding behind barriers and occasionally bringing
out UML diagrams. Several times, when we were debating which technical choice to make, held chime in with valuable
points about what would be better if we were to integrate with another service, or something like “that team did this
because blah, which might be relevant to you”.

   • It's typically a journey up and down the stack in terms of frontend, backend, and DevOps, and a journey in and out
     of solving inherently complex problems (where the seams of your services are, authentication) and incidentally
     complex problems (frameworks, machine-specific issues, Docker hell etc.)

   • 80% what needs to be done today/what fires need putting out, and 20% planning for the future and seeing how the
     bleeding edge can legitimately help us (e.g. WASM coming soon...). This is part of the general keeping up with
     advances in industry

   • Mentoring, jumping on pair programming calls to unblock other teammates.

This reflects my experience as well. Roadmap plannings and API designing between systems, communicating and
enforcing best practices within the time constraints, meetings with different service developers/designers to solve the
upcoming features... Less coding, more meeting and reviewing, overall clear view of the big picture is a must.

It sounds like you're very good at what you do. Sadly I've seen "architects" being more focused on drawings, crude
prototypes and fluffy ideas. Basically dreaming up ideas and concepts, throwing them over the wall to developers and
SREs to pick up. A previous boss of mine had to callback a candidate for a job, telling him, that despite us hiring pretty
much anyone, we had no need for someone who thought of software architecture as a desk exercise.

These fluff and idea types are typically called "Ivory Tower" architects (from my experience). reply

Seems like a lot of ongoing o&m and sustainment of an existing product, similar to any other day-to-day. Do you have
insight on what the proposal, design review, and first commits look like when architecting a brand new project? Like
what do the first 30-60-90 days look like from product idea up to those o&m and sustainment activities?
