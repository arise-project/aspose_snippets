     I am constantly agonising over choices I'm about to make You cannot predict the future. It is impossible
     know which choice will result in better outcomes. Whatever you choose has probably about equal chance of
     success or failure. So just make a choice, with a general idea of what you will do when the choice fails. Most
     choices are not make-or-break, so you should really not be agonizing over most choices.

     It is impossible know which choice will result in better outcomes. Whatever you choose has probably about
     equal chance of success or failure. It's a common fallacy to assign 50/50 probability to unknown
     distributions. Furthermore, many choices are not binary, or may not be as simple as right/wrong in hindsight.

But I agree with the idea of amortizing your perspective over many choices.

How do you personally deal with designing solutions where you haven't been able to convince people to do the right
thing? For example where there are limitations imposed on you or someone higher up makes a call that doesn't sit well
with you reply

It does happen, quite often, to be honest. The single most important thing in this case is to understand why it happened. A
typical example is when we come up with a design proposal that I think is a good one, but turns out to be that the
estimated cost of building and running it outweighs the projected revenue the product will generate. Another example
would be when I want to have a particular design implemented by an engineering team but they don't have enough
capacity (people, time, etc) to deliver it the way it was intended. There have been cases when it was all about politics
(sadly, I must add, but it does happen), i.e. someone in higher places of power want to push their own agenda and you get
overruled. These are cases when the previously mentioned 'professional negotiator' role gets really important. These are
the cases when you need to go to the people involved and try to understand their priorities and their constraints. Once
you have the information necessary, most of the times you'll be able to come up with an alternative solution that is
acceptable for everyone. Sometimes you can convince others to give way, sometimes you'll need to.

And then there are times when you just can't do anything because, for example, you get overruled by an overzealous
CTO. In these cases, as sho_hn also pointed out, the best you can do is to make them understand the implications and
brace yourself for damage control, because the fallout is going to be on you anyway :)

Make sure you negotiate the responsibilities of your role so that you can say "I'm not able to sign off on this". You may
get overridden anyway, but the consequences must be known. And if you got people to agree that you should be able to
say this, they usually understand the gravity of you having to invoke it and will live by it. reply

CYA. Send an email to the higher up stating the negative impact that their decision will impose, and ask them to confirm
that they would still like to proceed. Then don't do anything related to that decision until they respond. reply

Same. This is a great depiction of a healthy practice. reply
