Seems like a lot of ongoing o&m and sustainment of an existing product, similar to any other day-to-day. Do you have
insight on what the proposal, design review, and first commits look like when architecting a brand new project? Like
what do the first 30-60-90 days look like from product idea up to those o&m and sustainment activities?

I've had an "architect" job in some form or another for 20+ years, so have learnt plenty of things that would have greatly
surprised my younger self... My day job is basically to be a "force multiplier" and it boils down to:

   • cat herding = meetings, discussions, negotiation, "shoulder to cry on" = way more soft skills then I ever thought I'd
     need

   • Big picture stuff = "town planning" for tech, second order thinking, pulling together cohesive plans/strategies,
     principles, constraints = way harder to effectively communicate this stuff than my younger stuff would have
     thought

   • rapid altitude changes = dropping from the 10000ft view down to helping a team troubleshoot some production
     issue, helping a junior dev with a code issue, solving a dispute between devs, hands on evaluation of some new
     tech, then jumping back up to talk to a leadership team about some new grand strategy, or to planning out a multi
     year program of work = a ton of skills that my younger self would have never have guessed at, finance, budgets,
     "business" language, operating models along with keeping my technical skills sharp

In terms of resources:

   • Anything around learning to story tell and communicate effectively

   • The "97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know" essays

   • Your tech skills - write PoC apps, side-projects, try out new tech, learn to quickly grok strengths & weaknesses of
     tech

Noticing a theme already.. architects are fun killers! “Good architects prefer plain, old working tools.”
